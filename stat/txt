Chapter 8: T-Test
Definition
T-Test: A statistical test used when sample size is small (n < 30) or population standard deviation is unknown.
When to Use:
? Small sample (n < 30) OR
? Population standard deviation unknown
? Sample follows approximately normal distribution


Types of T-Test
1. One-Sample T-Test: Compare sample mean with known value 2. Independent T-Test: Compare means of two different groups
 3. Paired T-Test: Compare before-and-after data of same group
Example 1: One-Sample T-Test - Coffee Shop Sales
Situation: Coffee shop owner thinks average daily sales increased from last year's ?5000.
Data: 15 recent days sales
?5200, ?4800, ?5400, ?5100, ?5300, ?4900, ?5250, ?5050,
?5150, ?5350, ?4950, ?5180, ?5080, ?5220, ?5120

Calculations:
? Sample mean = ?5140
? Sample standard deviation = ?168
? Sample size = 15
T-Test:
t = (5140 - 5000) / (168 / ?15)
t = 140 / 43.4
t = 3.23

Result: With t = 3.23 and 14 degrees of freedom, sales significantly increased!
Example 2: Independent T-Test - Comparing Two Classes
Situation: Compare test scores of two different classes.
Class A (20 students): 85, 88, 82, 90, 87, 84, 89, 86, 83, 91, 85, 87, 84, 88, 86, 89, 82, 90, 85, 87 Average A = 86.2
Class B (18 students): 78, 81, 79, 83, 80, 77, 82, 79, 81, 84, 78, 80, 82, 79, 81, 83, 77, 80 Average B = 80.2
Question: Is 6-point difference significant?
T-Test Result: Yes, Class A performed significantly better than Class B.
Example 3: Paired T-Test - Weight Loss Program
Situation: Test if weight loss program works.
Same 10 people, before and after:
Person  Before  After  Difference
1       80      77     -3
2       85      82     -3
3       90      85     -5
4       75      74     -1
5       88      84     -4
6       92      88     -4
7       78      76     -2
8       86      83     -3
9       91      87     -4
10      82      79     -3

Average difference = -3.2 kg
T-Test: Is -3.2 kg weight loss significant or just normal variation?
Result: Yes, the weight loss program works significantly!
Example 4: Restaurant Rating Comparison
Situation: Restaurant owner changed menu. Compare ratings before and after.
Before Menu Change (12 days): 4.1, 4.0, 4.2, 3.9, 4.1, 4.0, 4.3, 3.8, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, 4.1 Average = 4.07
After Menu Change (12 days): 4.4, 4.3, 4.5, 4.2, 4.6, 4.3, 4.4, 4.1, 4.5, 4.4, 4.2, 4.3
 Average = 4.35
T-Test: Is 0.28 improvement significant? Yes!
